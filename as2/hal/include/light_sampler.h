// sampler.h
// Module to sample light levels in the background (uses a thread).
//
// It continuously samples the light level, and stores it internally.
// It provides access to the samples it recorded during the _previous_
// complete second.
//
// The application will do a number of actions each second which must
// be synchronized (such as computing dips and printing to the screen).
// To make easy to work with the data, the app must call 
// Sampler_moveCurrentDataToHistory() each second to trigger this 
// module to move the current samples into the history.
